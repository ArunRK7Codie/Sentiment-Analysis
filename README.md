# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is a tool to monitor people or consumer sentiment over any matter of idea or product. It uses Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning model to classify and segment into difference sentiments.

## Deep Learning Model
Sentiment Analysis based on a deep learning based algorithm which classifies any given text into different sentiments (Positive or Negative). You can look into this [notebook](https://github.com/ArunRK7Codie/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/sentiment_analysis_notebook.ipynb). This model is based on LSTM based Neural Network Architecture. 
### Dependency Bucket
-   **Tensorflow** - Deep Learning Framework
-   **Keras** - High Level Neural Networks Layers API
-   **scikit-learn** - Preprocessing Utilities
-   **Pandas** - Advance Data Structure Library
-   **Numpy** - Matrix Manipulations
-   **NLTK** - Natural Language Toolkit
-   **Re** - Regular Expression Handler
-   **Matplotlib** - Visualization library
-   **Pickle** - Implements binary protocols for serialization of objects

I would recommend you to see my well descriptive notebook which walk through the entire process in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arunrk7/nlp-beginner-text-classification-using-lstm).
## Sentiment Analyst - The Web App
Sentiment Analyst is a web app that uses Sentiment Inference Model which is created before with API Server. It  It is built using Django on the backend which serves the model as a API along with React JS Framework on the frontend which provides dynamic web components.
