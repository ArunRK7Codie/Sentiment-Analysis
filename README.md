# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is a tool to monitor people or consumer sentiment over any matter of idea or product. It uses Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning model to classify and segment into difference sentiments.

## Deep Learning Model
Sentiment Analysis based on a deep learning based algorithm which classifies any given text into different sentiments (Positive or Negative). You can look into this [notebook](https://github.com/ArunRK7Codie/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/sentiment_analysis_notebook.ipynb). This model is based on LSTM based Neural Network Architecture.
